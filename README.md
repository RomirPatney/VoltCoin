# VoltCoin

This is a token whose aim is to track the volatility of a subset of the cryptocurrency market. There will be multiple instances of the token, each pointing at a different subset. The aim of the smart contract is to offer an index of the change in price over 1 hour, 1 day or even 1 week. This serves the purpose of giving the investors an indication of the current stability of the market and an option to transfer their savings into a more secure token.
